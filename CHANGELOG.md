# Changelog

NomiFun is pre-1.0. Until the first public release, this file records release
notes at a high level rather than a complete historical log.

## Unreleased

- Added a Skill Market tab to the independent Skills capability, with bounded
  ClawHub and Skills.sh ranking sync, tag/search filtering, localized skill
  descriptions, and a reviewed installation draft handoff to Nomi.

## v0.1.13 - 2026-07-01

- Improved orchestration reliability and control: DAG node pre-configuration,
  per-node model selection, explicit in-conversation approval before execution,
  and fixes for broken DAG lines, orphaned running nodes, one-node planning, and
  blank pending states.
- Added graceful handling for providers/models that do not support image input:
  image capability tracking, proactive image removal, retry without interrupting
  the conversation, and a visible in-conversation notice.
- Expanded browser-use controls with silent mode defaults, managed/system
  browser source selection, persistent encrypted browser login, a one-click
  browser login action, and screenshot context for silent approvals.
- Fixed WebUI credential persistence across restarts and added per-model context
  window configuration.
- Polished updater error handling, local update test clients, README screenshots,
  provider quick links, and contact assets.
- Packaging note: this Mac-side release publishes macOS installer and updater
  assets. Windows and Linux packages must be added later from their native build
  machines.

## v0.1.12 - 2026-07-01

- Documentation overhaul for public website and open-source preparation.
- Clarified desktop, web, remote access, AutoWork, scheduled tasks, and
  packaging documentation.
- Removed proprietary PDF skill assets from the bundled built-in skills.

Every public release should include:

- User-facing changes.
